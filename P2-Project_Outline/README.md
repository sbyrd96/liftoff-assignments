## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Include overview here

When planning a vacation or trip, it is easy to lose track of all the details. Transportation and hotel reservations, show times, events, and ticket information to name a few. It would be helpful to have a central place to track information where multiple people can have access. 

My web-based application will track and organize vacation-related information. For each trip, a user will be able to create an itinerary and track all related information, including expenses. 

I decided to create this app because I am currently planning several trips and keeping track of all the details and sharing with my husband has always been a struggle. 

Though I think it might be ambitious for this liftoff portion, eventually I'd like to make the itineraries sharable and add a map to plot destinations within each individual trip. 

### Features
Include Features here

•	User login: Users will be able to create accounts and log into the application. Each user will have a profile page with links to previous trips and your current trips.

•	Trip planning page: Users will fill in fields to populate trip details. There will be helpful links to popular booking apps and travel sites. Later users will be able to click on each separate trip and view all  details related to that event. 

•	Reservations page: This will be a page that stores confirmation numbers and date/time details. Keeping this on a separate page will keep the trip planning page clean. But will be included on itinerary page.

•	Itinerary page: Will list all information previously entered in a concise manner.

### What I'll Have to Learn
Include what you will need to learn here

I would like to solidify my Java skills. Building a project from the ground up will help me accomplish this.

As far as learning something new, I will need to learn some JavaScript to deal with the possible interactive map. Also finding the ways that JavaScript will make my front-end more interactive will be intergral to making my app more useful.
